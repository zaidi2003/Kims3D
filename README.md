# KIMS Bookstore Virtual Experience

This project is a **web-based 3D visualization** of a point cloud model of a bookstore, created using **Three.js** and deployed with **Vite**. It allows users to explore the bookstore in an interactive and smooth way, with zoom controls, clickable hotspots, and rotation controls.

## Features

- **Smooth 3D rendering** of the model for fast interaction without lag.  
- **Dedicated zoom in/out buttons** to explore the model.  
- **Hotspots**: click on points to view images related to that area.
